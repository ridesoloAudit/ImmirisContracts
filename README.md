Smart contracts of the D-App https://www.immiris.com

----

IMMIRIS is a D-App on the Ethereum blockchain that let the user edit their own legal statement certifying the correct display of the building permit on a construction site. In France, the law enforce specific rules related to the position and visibility of the building permit panel on construction sites. It currently involves the certification of the display by a bailiff, which is an expensive and time consuming process.

IMMIRIS leverages the immutable nature of the blockchain to record and timestamp the details of the bulding permit panel as well as a unique hash identifying related photos stored on IPFS, thus cuting the need for a bailiff.
